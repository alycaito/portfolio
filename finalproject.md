# Final Project
## Outline

Title: Cash is King?

Premise:

Problem: While the poverty rate in Africa has slowly decreased, the number of extremely poor people continues to rise.

Potential solution: 

Myth 1 - Poor people who are given cash assistance with no conditions will waste it on temptation goods or luxury items.
   
Myth 2 - Cash interventions aren't as impactful as traditional social programs as a poverty reduction strategy
- Cash benchmarking study showed that cash more effective than WASH or nutrition programs
  

Call to action: Support direct cash transfers to the poor. Donate to the charity GiveDirectly that is providing cash transfer
