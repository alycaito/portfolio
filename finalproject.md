# Final Project
## Outline

Title: Cash is King?

Premise:

Problem: While the poverty rate in Africa has slowly decreased, the number of extremely poor people continues to rise.

Potential solution: 

Myth 1 - Poor people who are given cash assistance with no conditions will waste it on temptation goods or luxury items.
   
Myth 2 - Cash interventions aren't as impactful as traditional social programs as a poverty reduction strategy
- Cash benchmarking study showed that cash more effective than WASH or nutrition programs
  

Call to action: Support direct cash transfers to the poor. Donate to the charity GiveDirectly that is providing cash transfer

## Data

The World Bank [data](https://alycaito.github.io/portfolio/RegionalTable_1.9.csv) from PovcalNet will be used to demonstrate how the number of poor people in Sub-Saharan Africa is increasing over time. The dataset contains poverty estimates (assuming the poverty level of $1.90 a day) by region from 2015 to 1981 (although, not all regions have data back to 1981). It includes the poverty rate, poverty gap, squared poverty gap, and total regional population. The total number of people below the poverty line can be calculated by multiplying the poverty rate by the total regional population. I plan on using this data to demonstrate how the poverty rate has been decreasing in Sub-Saharan Africa, but the total number of people in poverty is actually increasing.

The [data](https://alycaito.github.io/portfolio/UCT_FINAL_CLEAN.dta) from Shapiro and Haushofer's randomized control trial contains survey data from 1440 households in 120 villages from 2011 to 2013. This data is in .dta format, which I will analyze in Stata. They also provide their dofiles (code) for conducting their econometric analysis, which I will use to replicate their results and then capture those estimates in a separate data file.

## Method and Medium
I will be using Shorthand to complete and present my final project. 

For the World Bank dataset and visualization, I currently intend to use the poverty rate and total number of people in poverty to create my visualization but I will experiment and see if some of the other measures included in my dataset yield interesting insights that I would like to present. The dataset contains data back to 1990 for Sub-Saharan Africa, but as part of my process I will determine how many years need to be included in my visualization to effectively present my point.
