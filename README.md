My Telling Stories with Data portfolio

# About Me

My name is Aly Caito and I am a first-year Master of Public Policy and Management student. Prior to CMU, I worked as a research manager for several randomized control trials related to micro-entrepreneurship in Ghana, Rwanda, India, and Mexico. I'm interested in international development, particularly the topics of education, employment, and social protection. After graduating I'd like to work in a research-oriented role in the international development field, translating policy research into action. 

# What I hope to learn

Through my previous work experience, I've learned that we can do everything right in conducting rigorous research but if we don't communicate the results well the valuable insights we uncovered will go unnoticed. In this class, I hope to learn how to create engaging data visualizations that effectively communicate data insights. I looking forward to learning about the dos and don'ts of data visualization so that I can create (or improve existing) visualization that are more impactful and capture people's (limited) attention.

## Visualization Critique and Redesign
### Original Visualization

I selected this visualization to redesign because I felt like there was a lot going in the chart, and the message wasn't clearly coming through. Although the original designers chose an intuitive way to represent the trends over time, the visualization could benefit from some design tweaks to make the message more salient.
#### Redesign process

After critiquing the original visualization, there were two main things I wanted to accomplish:
1) Streamline the design - cutting down on unneccessary clutter
2) Make the message that growth rates dropped because of a drought more obvious

In my wireframes (see below), I tried to make the X-axis easier to read and eliminated all the grid lines. I decided to make the GDP line gray since it seems the original designers wanted Agriculture and Food Crops to be the focal point of the visualization (as evidenced by the original title). I also removed the red bar, which was highlighted a survey period that had little to do with the message of the graph. Instead, I highlighted the period of drought that was mentioned in the text of the report (dates were mentioned in report text, and were not on original visualization). Since the point of the visualization was to depict how growth rates changed over time, especially after the drought, I reworked the title into something more informative and engaging.

When I asked two people to interpret and give feedback on my wireframes, I asked them to verbalize everything they were thinking as they look through the designs. I noticed that both people read the title first, and then either looked at the Y-axis or legend. Since these were the first things they noticed when looking at the visualization, I wanted to make sure in the redesign that these aspects of the chart were effective in capturing attention and clear. I'm happy with the title because I think it orients the viewer well when they first glance at the chart. One change I made from my wireframes in the final version was to change to Y-axis title to "Quarterly Growth Rate" instead of "GDP Quarterly Growth Rate." One person commented that initially they were confused and thought that the GDP growth rate scale only applied to the Total GDP line. 

Other feedback that I received was that blue/green color scheme was better than the red/orange. Also, highlighting the drought period with the gray shading was preferred to the dotted line design.

In the final visualization, I wasn't able to redesign the x-axis to exactly how I had envisioned it, but I still think the new design is an improvement over the original. In Tableau, I had added a tool tip to show the value of each point on the lines, but the original version appears in a PDF report, so that feature would not be practical for context in which the visualization appears. 

### Re-Designed Visualization

This visualization shows how the growth rate of the Agricultural sector, Food crops, and total GDP change over time from Quarter 4 in 2014 to Quarter 2 in 2018 in Rwanda. From Quarter 4 of 2015 to Quarter 4 of 2016, some provinces in Rwanda experienced an exceptionally long drought which negatively impacted crop yields. In the chart, it is apparent that growth rates for the agricultural sector and food crops decreased during the drought period. Total GDP also decreased, although there was a bit more of a lag.

Although the changes from the original to the redesigned version are not significant, I think the new visualization more clearly communicates the information written in the report. The viewer will be able to draw conclusions about the trends they are seeing in the graph much quicker in the new version.
