My Telling Stories with Data portfolio

# About Me

My name is Aly Caito and I am a first-year Master of Public Policy and Management student. Prior to CMU, I worked as a research manager for several randomized control trials related to micro-entrepreneurship in Ghana, Rwanda, India, and Mexico. I'm interested in international development, particularly the topics of education, employment, and social protection. After graduating I'd like to work in a research-oriented role in the international development field, translating policy research into action. 

# What I hope to learn

Through my previous work experience, I've learned that we can do everything right in conducting rigorous research but if we don't communicate the results well the valuable insights we uncovered will go unnoticed. In this class, I hope to learn how to create engaging data visualizations that effectively communicate data insights. I looking forward to learning about the dos and don'ts of data visualization so that I can create (or improve existing) visualization that are more impactful and capture people's (limited) attention.
